# Introduction
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for creating and manipulating large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices in Python. It is essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computations.

Created by Travis Oliphant in 2005, NumPy continues to be open-source and supported by a vibrant community.

# Key Features
N-Dimensional Arrays (ndarray): Perform efficient operations on arrays.

Mathematical Functions: Includes algebra, Fourier transforms, and random numbers.

Optimized for Performance: Fast computations with optimized CPU operations.

Integration with Other Libraries: Serves as a foundation for pandas, scikit-learn, and more.
